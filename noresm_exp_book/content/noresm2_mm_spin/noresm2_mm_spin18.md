## Summary of simulation

New in this simulation: 
- New inital data file used in CLM5
- Changes in history settings (for extended output) in user_nl_cam and user_nl_clm and removed CPLHIST output to user_nl_cpl


Continued to use:
- preprocessorDefinitions.h: CPP flags: "#undef AEROCOM‚Äù, "#define AEROFFL"
- clubb_gamma_coef =  0.286
- the modifications to cldfrc2m.F90
- CESM2.1.0 (branch featureCESM2.1.0-OsloDevelopment)
- the correction of bug in the second-order in time term of the AM correction (cd_core.F90)
- the removal of an inconsistency in the treatment of riverine carbon inputs in iHAMOCC (mo_riverinpt.F90)
- the increased (x2) error tolerance in energy conservation test in CICE
- the long wave aerosol optical depth (AOD) bug fixer optinterpol.F90 included as SourceMod
- the updated emission files for CAM6-Nor (often referred to as FRC2)
- the increase in DMS emissions @ high latitudes in order to reduce the net radiation imbalance @TOM (top of model)
- the increase in width of Strait of Gibraltar  from 15 km to 30 km
- the modifications to the parameterisation of ice clouds (iceopt=5 and cldfrc2m.F90)
- the modifications to the parameters bkopal, rcalc and ropal in iHAMOCC included as SourceMod
- the modifications to the convection code included as SourceMod: zm_conv.F90: "zmst" modifications.
- aerotab_table_dir = '/cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/noresm-only/atm/cam/camoslo/AeroTab_8jun17'

File modifications to 
- CAM6-Nor: zm_conv.F90, cd_core.F90, optinterpol.F90. 
- CICE:  ice_therm_vertical.F90
- iHAMOCC: mo_riverinpt.F90, beleg_bgc.F90

were merged into featureCESM2.1.0-OsloDevelopment and the SourceMods no longer needed. Also the new emission files (frc2) and many of the parameter settings in user_nl_cam were included and no longer needed to be listed in user_nl_cam.

The increase in width of Strait of Gibraltar from 15 km to 30 km was included as default and no longer listed in user_nl_micom

The reset snow addition in user_nl_clm was included as default and no longer needed.

## User name lists

### gamma

*Gamma* controls the skewness of Gaussian PDF for the subgrid vertical velocities (used in the Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (CLUBB) scheme).  A low gamma generally increases the amount of low clouds and hence gives a higher short-wave cloud forcing.

### iceopt

Iceopt is used for setting the parameterisation of ice-cloud fraction. The CESM2 default scheme for the parameterisation of the ice-cloud fraction is iceopt = 5, which includes a functional dependence of ice cloud fraction on the environmental relative humidity.
