## Future scenarios 
### Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 
SSPs: Shared Socioeconomic Pathways serve as basis for new emissions and socio-economic scenarios for future climate projections used in CMIP6:

- SSP1:	Sustainability – Taking the Green Road (Low challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
- SSP2:	Middle of the Road (Medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
- SSP3:	Regional Rivalry – A Rocky Road (High challenges to mitigation and adaptation)
- SSP4:	Inequality – A Road Divided (Low challenges to mitigation, high challenges to adaptation)
- SSP5	Fossil-fueled Development – Taking the Highway (High challenges to mitigation, low challenges to adaptation)

See Riahi 2017 for a more detailed description (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300681)
and BC O’Neill 2016 (https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3461/2016/gmd-9-3461-2016.pdf)

### Representative Concentration Pathways
RCPs: Representative Concentration Pathways are future projections of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and subsequent radiative forcing. 
The number after RCP represent the radiative forcing by year 2100.

- RCP2.6: radiative forcing peaks at ~3W/m2 before year 2100 and then declines
- RCP4.5: radiative forcing stabilises at approximately 4.5 W/m2 after year 2100 
- RCP7.0: radiative forcing stabilises at approximately 7.0 W/m2 after year 2100 
- RCP8.5: radiative forcing reaches greater than 8.5W/m2 by year 2100

The forcing used in CMIP6 for future projections are combinations of SSPs and RCPs.

### SSP-based RCP scenarios:
- **SSP1-2.6:** SSP-based RCP scenario with low radiative forcing by the end of the century. Following approximately RCP2.6 global forcing pathway with SSP1 socioeconomic conditions. Radiative forcing reaches a level of 2.6 W/m2 in 2100. Concentration-driven. The scenario represents the low end of the range of plausible future pathways. The scenario depicts the "best case" future from the sustainability perspective.
- **SSP2-4.5:** SSP-based RCP scenario with medium radiative forcing by the end of the century. Following approximately RCP4.5 global forcing pathway with SSP2 socioeconomic conditions. Radiative forcing reaches a level of 4.5 W/m2 in 2100. Concentration-driven. The scenario represents the medium part of the range of plausible future pathways.
- **SSP3-7.0:** Baseline scenario with a medium to high radiative forcing by the end of century. Following approximately RCP7.0 global forcing pathway with SSP3 socioeconomic conditions. Radiative forcing reaches a level of 7.0 W/m2 in 2100. Concentration-driven. The scenario represents the medium to high end of plausible future pathways. SSP3-7.0 fills a gap in the CMIP5 forcing pathways that is particularly important because it represents a forcing level common to several (unmitigated) SSP baselines.
- **SSP5-8.5:** SSP-based RCP scenario with high radiative forcing by the end of century. Following approximately RCP8.5 global forcing pathway with SSP5 socioeconomic conditions. Concentration-driven. The scenario represents the high end of plausible future pathways. SSP5 is the only SSP with emissions high enough to produce the 8.5 W/m2 level of forcing in 2100.
