# Summary of simulation

New in this simulation: 
-  Spin up simulation moved from Nebula @ nsc.liu to Fram @ sigma2 and an identical simulation on Vilje @ sigma2


Continued to use
-  CESM2.1
-  gamma = 0.264
-  the removal of an inconsistency in the treatment of riverine carbon inputs in iHAMOCC
-  new emission files to avoid mid-month crashes from yr 891. We have not experienced any mid-month crashes after.
-  the long wave aerosol optical depth (AOD) bug fixer
-  the increase in DMS emissions @ high latitudes in order to reduce the net radiation imbalance @TOM (top of model)
-  Nebula @ nsc.liu
-  the increased width of Strait of Gibraltar
-  the increased (x2) error tolerance in energy conservation test in CICE (code changes included in the main CICE code)
-  the modifications to the parameters *bkopal, rcalc and ropal* in iHAMOCC  included as SourceMod 
-  the modifications to the convection code included as SourceMod 
-  the namelist changes compared to repository for CAM6-Nor, MICOM and CLM5

# Code modifications (SourceMods)
All code modifications merged to featureCESM2.1.0-OsloDevelopment 54075ac, so no SourceMods needed

# User name lists
All user list settings included in the main source code, so no user list settings needed. 
However, the "old" user_nl_clm (should not have any impact at all)

## user_nl_clm

Reset snow: Remove infiltration excess water as runoff if the temperature of the surface water pool is below freezing.
