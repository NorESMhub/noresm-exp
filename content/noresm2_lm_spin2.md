# Summary of simulation
- To reduce the net radiation imbalance @TOM (top of model) the sea-salt emissions were increased by 10% 
- Increased (x2) error tolerance in energy conservation test in CICE
- Modifications to the convection code included as SourceMod 
- Continued to use the previous namelist changes compared to repository for CAM6-Nor, MICOM and CLM5
- *New* namelist additions compared to repository for CAM6-Nor:
  - aerotab_table_dir = '/cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/noresm-only/atm/cam/camoslo/AeroTab_20oct16' -> '/cluster/shared/noresm/inputdata/noresm-only/atm/cam/camoslo/AeroTab_8jun17'
 - Namelist changes compared to repository for MICOM:
   - bkopal = 1.e-6 -> 5.e-6
   - rcalc = 48. -> 35.
   - ropal = 35. -> 45.

## Includes the long wave aod error

**Information about the bug:** The aerosol long wave calculations used information from the aerosol shortwave interpolation on aerosol size. The result was that aerosol longwave forcing was not included during night. A first estimate based on estimates from AMIP simulation is + 0.03 W/m2. The forcing is not evenly distributed, but mostly focused on Sahara including downstream and the Arabian peninsula. The numbers here are around 1-2 W/m2.  

Note this bug was fixed in N1850OCBDRDDMS_f19_tn14_07052019
